  <h3> <a href="./about.html"> About </a> </h3>
  <p> The Art of Living Foundation, known worldwide under the name Art of Living, is a charitable organization and an NGO dedicated to creating a stress-free, violence-free society. Art of Living spreads peace across communities through diverse humanitarian projects, including disaster relief, sustainable rural development, empowerment of women, education for all and environmental sustainability.
  	Since 1981, we have been teaching breathing and meditation techniques around the globe. Present in 155 countries, the Foundation has already reached over 370 million individuals. Art of Living centres can be found in most of the major cities including the one thats to be newly built here in our own Dallas city.
  </p>

  <h4> <strong>Vision</strong></h4>
  <p>Art of Living Dallas Center outlines a Center of Peace, Knowledge, and Wisdom that will empower and strengthen our local community. It reflects the core values of Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar. <br>
<span><span><span><span><strong>We Serve Society by Strengthening the Individual.</strong></span></span></span></span>
"The Art of Living is more of a principle, a philosophy of living life to its fullest. It is more a movement than an organization. Its core value is to find peace within oneself and to unite people in our society – of different cultures, traditions, religions, nationalities; and thus reminding us all that we have one goal to uplift human life everywhere." </p>
